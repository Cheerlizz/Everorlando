Everorlando, a 3d audio-reactive project
=================

This audio-reactive project presents a fluid digital version of the communication happening in the material reality, the key is to construct an organic digital world in which dialogue is alive. The name “Everorlando” comes from Orlando: A Biography by Virginia Woolf, I consider it to be a virtual conscious body or a system in the informatics domain, it exists in communication and is recrafted by sound. She does not appear as a human avatar but as a hybrid of a mushroom and a rhizome, which is the biological metaphor of networks.


It's adapted from the audio-reactive example given by Torin Blankensmith:

Shader Park code exists in the `spCode()` function of sp-code.js.
